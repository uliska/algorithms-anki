# algorithms-anki

Deck of Anki Cards covering "Data Structures and Algorithms" as taught by the 
[Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)
by the University of California San Diego .

The idea behind this repository is to collaboratively work on a deck of cards covering the lectures
from the Coursera specialization. The wealth of information from these courses can only be 
maintained by permanently applying it in practice - and/or by properly learning it, and Anki seems
to be a good tool for this kind of study.

Creating such a huge corpus of cards is calling for collaboration - as it will probably take 
a multiple of the time actually going through the courses. So this repository consists of
two elements: Anki card contents and a build system that allows to collaboratively maintain
the contents in a Git repository.

The build system will be built with Python3 and [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki).
